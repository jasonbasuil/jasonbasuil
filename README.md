Hi everyone! So glad you could stop by my Github. 

## Currently 
Thinking about my next career move. Curious about the low-code movement, state management, fintech, human psychology, the biological basis of learning, and the role AI will play in the future of our educational systems. 

## My background 

- (2008) Wrote my first line of code with Myspace. Was fascinated, but didn't stick with it.
- (2017) Graduated from college with a degree in Biology with the original intention of heading to dental school. Took a class on Data Driven programming in Python and became more curious.
- (2017) Decided to take my first career pivot when I joined a Seattle startup doing customer support / sales.
- (2018) Decided to take my second career pivot a year later by attending a coding bootcamp to learn full-stack software engineering.
- (2019) Got my first engineering position! Frontend Engineering intern & eventually turned full-time Software Engineer.
- (2020) LOL. Let's just get this year over with.

## In my free time

- Fitness! Cycling, lifting, running, hiking, and volleyball! Would love to get into tennis.
- Family. They're everything.
- Cooking & Baking. I make a really great triple chocolate cake with strawberry whipped cream cheese filling! Also a big fan of bread.
- Destined for X. Love building this organization and working with driven students. Check us out! [Destined for X](https://www.destinedforx.com)
